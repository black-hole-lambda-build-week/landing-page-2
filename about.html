    <h2>What is the Blackhole?</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever had a fit of anger so deep that you needed to release your
      primal voice? Has a person or a thing ever irritated you so much that you
      needed to yell it to the world? Enter the Blackhole. The ever gravitating
      hole that sucks up your pent up anger. Vent into it, yell into it, TYPE IN
      ALL CAPS IF YOU HAVE TO, release it to the hole and watch it be destroyed
      in orbit. When you're ready to think about it again the blackhole's orbit
      will pull it back around to view your rant in full glory.
    </p>

    <h2>What inspired the blackhole?</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes we humans need to rant. We can and will rant about anything, but
      sometimes our rants are heard by the wrong people. Our fit of anger can
      hurt our relationships and land us in a whole heap of trouble. Thus
      BLACKHOLE was born. The simple app that allows you to rant to strangers on
      the internet without the repercusions of the real world. Let go of your
      anger and give it to the hole.
